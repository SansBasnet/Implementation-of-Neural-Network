Implementing Neural Network on Irish dataset 

On Irish dataset (uploaded on Irish folder here), this algorithm evalutes: accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Crossentropy and log-likelihood. Followed by that, the function returns those five results that are correctcount, accuracy, MSE, Crossentropy and Loglikelihood in a list.

The goal is to generate the following curves of Test versus Train:

<img src = "images/error_cruves.png" width = "480" height = "310">

<img src = "images/test_v_train.png" width = "480" height = "310">

<img src = "images/test_v_train_1.png" width = "480" height = "310">

<img src = "images/test_v_train_2.png" width = "480" height = "310">
