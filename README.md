Implementing Neural Network on Irish data 

On Irish dataset (uploaded on Irish folder here), this algorithm evalutes accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Cross-entropy and log-likelihood. After that, the function returns those five results (correctcount, accuracy, MSE, Cross-entropy and log-likelihood) in a list.
